-- Wanted: where wanted players have been. Sightings (yours and other Wanted users') of anyone with an open
-- bounty on them or their guild, or on your Kill on Sight list, are kept per player for a month, so a
-- hunter can see their usual zones and the hours they're about. Other enemies aren't kept: the saved data
-- would grow with every player you ever pass.
--
-- Seeing someone with an open bounty also makes a "spotted" record (at most every few minutes per target),
-- which syncs like any record: across the channel, to players catching up, and over realm links. So every
-- hunter's history has everyone's sightings, from before they took the bounty too. Kill on Sight sightings
-- stay private (the list is personal). Spotted records are dropped once they're older than the history.
